# Conway's Game of Life

I completed this project as part of my study at [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/).

This is a console app built to simulate [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) with a randomly generated 10x10 grid.

A live cell is represented by a 1 and a dead cell is represented by a 0.

The rules of the game are:

- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
